  "Coding is a modern day artform, it is the foundation to a more convenient future. An artform that can be portrayed in various ways whether it be Java or Python. If you practice the art of coding and gain solace in finding bugs, this is the module for you. It won't be a piece of Raspberry Pi though, in our coliseum of coding you will face a wall of encryption so don't just rely on your coding prowess. It will be the ultimate test of your problem solving skills. We present to you our cryptography and coding module 'Autocode'.",
  "Our whole universe is a never ending enigma. Whole of our existence is clouded in a mystery. From ancient Greeks to modern scientists, all have relied on mathematics to crack the universe's enigma. Mathematics is reflected in the phenomena of the cosmos, it is the sustenance of our modern world. This module will be the ultimate crucible, where different elements of mathematics will clash and you will have to forge your own solution. In order to solve our enigma, keep an inquisitive mind with a flair of unconventionality. Presenting to you our mathematics module, 'Euclid's Elements'.",
  "Is the world we know as ours only limited to the Four Basic elements; Earth, Water, Fire and Air or is there more to it? What is even the Spring of Air? What is a Chemical Paradox? If such questions ignite the fire of curiosity within you then this is the module you will dominate. Craft the perfect concoction from the unknowns to conquer our chemistry module, 'Sceptical Chymist'.",
  "Let’s phrase it even more strongly, “If everybody is thinking alike, then only one person is thinking.” The task of the creative thinker is to look at what everybody else is looking at and to see something different. Futuristic ideas and thoughts are often met with a look of skepticism, but if you possess the will and determination to turn fiction into reality, this is the module for you. A century ago, self-driving cars were just a madman's dream but decades later, the dream slowly came to fruition. Become the next Elon Musk and bring your own Tesla to life or anything else you can ponder upon in a module filled with mechanical mayhem with a hefty side of coding conundrums to give you the most immersive experience possible. Embark on your robotic rampage! Introducing our robotics module, 'Robosonic.'",
  "Our tribute to Alessandro Volta and his life-changing creation of the first-ever battery—Voltaic pile—this module is based on electrochemistry! The Voltaic is here to shock you, indulge yourself in the world of currents, power and energy. Play with electricity and challenge your potential to make complex circuits on PCB. Introducing our electrochemistry module 'The Voltaic'.",
  "To construct is to master the art of knowing how our world functions beneath and beyond. Our ode to M.C. Escher and Mr. Penrose and who created the impossible illusion of an infinite staircase by constructing a Penrose triangle - this module would require you to use your given resources to build-up a particular model. This module will put your creativity under constant flux. Your success in Epsilon would be under-construction and doing wonders in this module would pave your way through! Introducing our construction module 'Escherian Stairwell'.",
  "The true essence of Area 51 lies in its mystery. And would this module still remain a work of art if it’s secrets are revealed? The answer is 'no'. If unpredictability is your forte, this is the perfect module for you. Dive into the unknown and emerge victorious. Our advise is to sit tight and enjoy this mysterious odyssey where Area 51 unfolds itself. Introducing our mystery module 'Area 51'.",
  "The true sign of an inquisitive mind is noticing the minuscule details. If you possess the skill of deduction and can see the traps within traps, this is the perfect module for you. We have set the game, can you find your way to the real culprit or will you fall victim to our murder maze. The key to unlocking the truth is analyzing every clue precisely. The game is afoot. Introducing our criminology module 'Cicada 3301'.",
  "Cerebral Labyrinth dares you to go beyond memorizing facts and learn the art to get curious about the world around you. Dive into a labyrinth of tricky questions and an unquenchable thirst of reading in an attempt to analyze and make connections between absolute trivial stuff! Introducing our trivia module 'Cerebral Labyrinth'.",
  "Biology has been leading the field of science to bring about fundamental changes ever since the ancient times. Since then many feats have been made possible due to the propagation of biology that have helped give us insight into the past, thus help shape the future and revamp the quality of life. This module is based on biology —an intrinsic aspect in the perimeters of science and the key to many of its discoveries. Here, Epsilon allows you to dive deeper into the world of biology and navigate your way through experimenting, inspecting, and analyzing intricate challenges. Introducing our biology module 'Carson's Conundrum'."
